I am a senior undergraduate student at **Sichuan University**. Currently, I am a research intern at the **University of Virginia**, working with [Prof. Jundong Li](https://jundongli.github.io/). Previously, I was a research assistant at **Chongqing University**.

My research interests mainly focus on the following directions, and I am also willing to exploring other emerging areas in artificial intelligence 🙌:
1. **Graph Mining & Data Mining**  
Graph neural networks, representation learning, and their applications in recommender systems and scientific discovery.  
2. **Machine Learning & Trustworthy AI**  
Robust and fair learning, interpretability, and responsible deployment.  
3. **Natural Language Processing & Large Language Models**  
Language understanding, knowledge integration, and AI for science.
